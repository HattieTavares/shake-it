# Shake-It

Shake-It is a fun and simple to use app built with React that allows users to upload an image, customize it with filters and "handwritten" fonts to look like a vintage polaroid, and then download it!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Vite, MUI, Netlify for hosting, Packages: HTML-to-Image for generating the custom image to download & FileSaver for downloading

## Optimizations

- Add more fonts and filters
- Add choice of downloading PNG or JPG

Stretch Goals:

- Add login and user functionality as well as a database for saving images
- Virtual PhotoBook/Album to display customized images
- Ability to share albums with friends and family

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time using MUI and I liked how easy it was to add various components into my project. I did not like not being able to customize them as easily as other libraries I've used. It felt less intuitive, especially for small changes.
